I&#8217;m going to be temporarily putting my work with _Seven Languages in Seven Weeks_ on hold so that I can explore some new PHP tools. I&#8217;ve accepted an offer at a new company, staring later this month, and want to devote some time to learning the tools they&#8217;ve picked out. For starters, we&#8217;ll be using Zend Framework 2 for the application that I&#8217;ll be focusing on.

I have experience with the original Zend Framework but, when ZF2 and Symfony 2 released, went the Symfony 2 route instead. Looking through the [Getting Started with Zend Framework 2](http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.0/en/user-guide/overview.html "Getting Started with Zend Framework 2") tutorial, I see things that are similar to both frameworks that I&#8217;m familiar with. That&#8217;s one of the awesome things about the PHP-FIG: cross pollination. 

I definitely intend to return to the exploration of new languages, but I want to be able to hit the ground running on this new project. Stay tuned.
