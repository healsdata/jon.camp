I always recommended [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html "Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years") to junior developers as a path to expand their skills. With some [gentle prodding](http://deliberate-software.com/how-to-escape-from-programming_language/") from a friend, I&#8217;ve decided that it&#8217;s time to take some of my own advice and focus on one of the recommendations from that article:

> Learn at least a half dozen **programming languages**. Include one language that supports class abstractions (like Java or C++), one that supports functional abstraction (like Lisp or ML), one that supports syntactic abstraction (like Lisp), one that supports declarative specifications (like Prolog or C++ templates), one that supports coroutines (like Icon or Scheme), and one that supports parallelism (like Sisal).

My professional work has been almost exclusively with PHP and JavaScript. I did a number of VB projects during school and there&#8217;s always a few tools you need to use or modify in other languages, but my experience with Ruby, Python and Perl doesn&#8217;t extend much beyond configuration, compiling and installation.

Recently I read through a good bit of [Learn You a Haskell for a Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/ "Learn You a Haskell for a Great Good") but I feel like I need a resource that&#8217;s more dedicated to teaching me what makes the language different and what it excels at, rather than an API reference guide. Enter [_Seven Languages in Seven Weeks_](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7912517-seven-languages-in-seven-weeks) by Bruce A. Tate.

> **I Will Take you Beyond Syntax**  
> To really get into the head of a language designer, you&#8217;re going to have to be willing to go beyond the basic syntax. That means you&#8217;ll have to code something more than the typically &#8220;Hello, World&#8221; or even a Fibonacci series.

The book covers Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure and Haskell which gives an amazing smattering of different typing and programming models. I&#8217;m really looking forward to working through the programming examples and challenges in the book.
