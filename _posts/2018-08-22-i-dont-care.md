At a previous job, one of my management mentors always took umbrage when someone asked me a question and my response was &#8220;I don&#8217;t care.&#8221; It took me a bit to understand that, when he heard me say that, he understood it as &#8220;this isn&#8217;t important, why are you bothering me?&#8221; He&#8217;d remind me that I did care about the results of the decision.

Thinking about it again recently, I started to clarify the situations where I use that phrase as shorthand for what I really mean.

**I Don&#8217;t Have a Strong Preference**

I&#8217;ll often see developers get locked in a heated, extended debate over the best way to implement some feature. Often times, when I&#8217;m asked to weigh in as the &#8220;tiebreaker&#8221; I&#8217;ll ask each person how much they care about the decision. If one person is passionate and the other is only playing devil&#8217;s advocate, the person who cares a lot should move forward with their idea.

**I Trust You to Handle the Details**

As a manager, I shouldn&#8217;t be making day-to-day decisions about implementation details. If I ask one of my directs to write a job posting, I&#8217;m not effectively delegating if I then nitpick their output or require them to ask me specific questions about every bullet point. That doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t review their work &#8212; I just remember to ask myself &#8220;is this important to change or just my preference&#8221; before asking for revisions.

**I Don&#8217;t Own This Decision**

There are times when someone will ask me my opinion on something and I don&#8217;t want to give an answer because it isn&#8217;t my decision to make. I want to avoid people later saying &#8220;but Jon said we should&#8230;&#8221; when in was only spitballing. An example might be the best way to design a user experience for our newest app. I&#8217;m happy to brainstorm with the team, but the product owner is the ultimate decision maker and should be present.

Communication is about the listener. Sometimes you might use a terse, flippant-sounding phrase as a shortcut for what you really mean. Take the time to articulate; people will appreciate the insight.
