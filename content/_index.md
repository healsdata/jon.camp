## Hello & Welcome to my Bliki!

I'm a technologist and engineering leader who's been programming since I was twelve and have been using technology to solve problems in the business world since 2000. 

### So why a bliki?

The most straightforward answer is that I'm bad at remembering to update a blog.
Rather than feel bad that I haven't published a new article in X number of
months, this format allows me to share a handful of articles you may find
interesting and update them why I learn something new. 

Additionally, I feel OK publishing a draft (marked as such) and hopefully returning later to finish it.
