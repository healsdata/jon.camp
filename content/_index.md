# Hello & Welcome to my Bliki!

I'm a technologist and leader who's been programming since I was twelve and
using my technology chops to solve problems in the business world since 2000.
Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on, and manage, a number
of awesome projects with scores of amazing engineers.

## So why a bliki?

The most straightforward answer is that I'm bad at remembering to update a blog.
Rather than feel sad that I haven't published a new article in X number of
months, this format allows me to share a handful of articles you may find
interesting and update them why I learn something new.

And honestly, you're probably here looking for one of my other links. In that
case, this is just a simple landing page and you can find all my socials linked
within.
