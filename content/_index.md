# Hello & Welcome!

I'm a technologist and engineering leader who's been programming since I was twelve and have been using technology to solve problems in the business world since 2000. 

## About that blog...

I'm bad at remembering to finish blog posts. I have a lot of ideas that never get past the first draft stage. 
I've decided to share drafts here, marked with *[DRAFT]* in the title until they're done. 

This allows me to share things I currently find interesting and update them why I learn something new.
