For years, proponents of [strong-style pairing](https://llewellynfalco.blogspot.com/2014/06/llewellyns-strong-style-pairing.html) have been searching for the perfect driver. Someone who will "trust the navigator's direction without needing complete understanding upfront." Someone who won't interrupt with pesky questions or, heaven forbid, have their own ideas about how to solve the problem.

Well, congratulations. AI coding assistants have arrived.

Think about it. The core rule of strong-style pairing is: "For an idea to go from your head into the computer it MUST go through someone else's hands." Claude, Copilot, Cursor -- they're all hands that aren't yours. And unlike your human teammates, they will never:

- Grab the keyboard to "just show you something real quick"
- Push back on your design decisions mid-thought
- Get frustrated when your verbal instructions are ambiguous
- Have the audacity to suggest a different approach

The strong-style purist's dream is a driver who types what they're told, asks clarifying questions only when truly stuck, and trusts that the navigator knows what they're doing. We've finally built that. It runs on GPUs and costs $20/month.

## The Quiet Part Out Loud

I've [written before](/all-the-techniques/) about my complicated relationship with strong-style pairing. The technique explicitly says that "the right time to discuss and challenge design decisions is **after** the solution is out of the navigator's head." The driver is supposed to implement first, understand later.

This always felt backwards to me. I've [long believed](/it-comes-down-to-asking-why/) that understanding *why* you're doing something is crucial -- that asking questions, challenging assumptions, and having a dialogue leads to better outcomes. Strong-style pairing asks you to suppress that instinct.

And now we have tools that don't have that instinct to suppress. They just... do the thing. Is that good?

## Be Careful What You Wish For

Here's the uncomfortable question: if your ideal pairing partner is one that never pushes back, never has independent ideas, and never challenges your thinking, what does that say about what you wanted from pairing in the first place?

The best human collaborators I've worked with *do* interrupt. They *do* say "wait, why are we doing it that way?" They bring their own context, experience, and ideas to the table. That friction -- which strong-style pairing tries to defer -- is often where the best solutions come from.

AI doesn't give you that friction. It gives you a very fast, very compliant typist.

Maybe that's exactly what some people wanted all along.
