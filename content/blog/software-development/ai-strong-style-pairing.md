The core premise of [strong-style pairing](https://llewellynfalco.blogspot.com/2014/06/llewellyns-strong-style-pairing.html) is this: "In order for an idea to go from your head into the computer, it must go through someone else's hands."[^1] The driver is explicitly told to "trust the navigator's direction without needing complete understanding upfront." In practice, this means the driver becomes a kind of dumb keyboard for the navigator. You sit at the controls, you type what you're told, and you hold your questions until later.

AI coding assistants have made this literal. Claude, Copilot, Cursor -- they are all hands that aren't yours. They will faithfully translate your intent into code. And unlike your human teammates, they will never grab the keyboard to "just show you something real quick" or push back on your design decisions mid-thought.

In that sense, they are the ultimate strong-style driver.

## What Made Me Think Twice

I've [written before](/all-the-techniques/) about my complicated relationship with strong-style pairing. The technique explicitly says that "the right time to discuss and challenge design decisions is **after** the solution is out of the navigator's head." The driver is supposed to implement first, understand later.

That always felt backwards to me. I've [long believed](/it-comes-down-to-asking-why/) that understanding *why* you're doing something is crucial -- that asking questions, challenging assumptions, and having a dialogue leads to better outcomes. Strong-style pairing asks the driver to suppress that instinct.

And now we have tools that don't have that instinct at all. They just... do the thing.

## Agentic Coding Is Genuinely Great

Let me be clear about something. AI coding agents are a force multiplier. I use them every day and they have made me meaningfully more productive. Being able to describe what I want and have an agent scaffold the implementation, run through tedious refactors, or explore an unfamiliar codebase on my behalf is a real superpower. The speed at which you can go from idea to working code is unlike anything we have had before.

The agent handles the mechanical work. It remembers syntax I have forgotten. It can hold more of the codebase in its head at once than I can. For a huge range of tasks, this is transformative.

But here is the thing. The output is only as good as the thinking that went into the prompt, plan, and skills. And the thinking is only as good as the process that shaped it.

## Two Brains Are Still Better

The best software I have ever worked on was built with real collaboration. Not one person dictating to a typist, but two people wrestling with a problem together. Catching each other's blind spots. Asking "what about this edge case" before it becomes a production incident. Bringing different experiences and perspectives to the same problem.

AI does not do that. It is an incredible tool, but it does not challenge your assumptions the way a good colleague does. It will not say "I worked on something like this two years ago and that approach ended up causing problems." It will not notice that your design works for the happy path but falls apart under load because it has seen that pattern fail before.

When you pair with another human, you get friction. And that friction is not a bug. It is the thing that catches mistakes, surfaces better ideas, and forces you to articulate your thinking clearly enough that someone else can genuinely evaluate it.

Agentic coding gives you an incredibly capable typist. Human collaboration gives you a second brain. The best workflow is not choosing one or the other. It is using the agent to move fast and a human partner to make sure you are moving in the right direction.
