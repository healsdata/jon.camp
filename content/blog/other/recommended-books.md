## Software Development

**_The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery_ by David Thomas, Andrew Hunt**

> Written as a series of self-contained sections and filled with classic and fresh anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, The Pragmatic Programmer illustrates the best approaches and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. Whether you’re a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you’ll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction. You’ll learn skills and develop habits and attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in your career.

**_The Nature of Software Development: Keep It Simple, Make It Valuable, Build It Piece by Piece_ by Ron Jeffries**

Earlier this year, I considered writing a book on my development opinions and lessons learned, only to find all that information contained in this book. 
This is quite an easy read but speaks to better ways to develop software to provide value and longevity. It provides recommendations you can fold into your
existing process or leverage in a particular sticky situation.

> During planning, especially short-term planning, it’s tempting to set up “stretch goals” or to “encourage” the team to do “just one more feature.” Please do not do this. It’s devastatingly destructive. The reason is that the team will in fact try. Eager to please, they’ll unconsciously hurry. They’ll leave out just a few tests. They’ll leave the code not quite as clean as they might have, just to squeeze in one more feature.

**_The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win_ by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford**

Unlike most other books in the technology space, this is a novelization that portrays the right and wrong way for IT, developers, and engineers to interact.
It includes a wise figure who doles out pieces of advice, so there's definitely actionable takeaways, but it also serves as a humorous read.

> Something seems wrong in a world where half the e-mail messages sent are urgent. Can everything really be that important?

## Leadership

**_Managing Humans_ by Michael Lopp**

Unlike most management books, this one is specifically geared towards the software industry. And yet it still espouses the same basic principle: it's all relationships and results. This book puts a humorous twist on many situations a new manager will encounter. The author's software background makes the material relatable to those who were developers and are now transitioning to management.

> My definition of a great manager is someone with whom you can make a connection no matter where you sit in the organization chart.

**_Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win_ by Jocko Willink & Leif Babin**

Willink and Babin mix pertinent war stories with leadership lessons that apply to any leader, whether in the military or in the business world.
Given the push for self-organizing teams in the world of Agile, I found the lessons here regarding empowering your team instead of micromanaging to be extremely relevant to technologists. Plus, the whole second on "Cover and Move" is helpful when working with other groups, such as IT, Product, etc.

> As SEALs, we operate as a team of high-caliber, multi-talented individuals who have been through perhaps the toughest military training and most rigorous screening process anywhere. But in the SEAL program, it is all about the Team. The sum is far greater than the parts.

## Fiction

**_His Majesty's Dragon_ by Naomi Novik**

Naval dragons during the Napoleonic Wars.

**_Foundryside_ by Robert Jackson Bennett**

A cyberpunk book but in a fantasy setting.
