I originally put together this list to help out some coworkers that were impacted by a layoff. Figured I could share it
on my blog and then send the link to anyone I know that's looking.

## Smaller, Cool Job Boards
### [People-First Jobs](https://peoplefirstjobs.com/)
A hand-curated list of companies and their current job posts. Updates arrive weekly in newsletter format.

### [4 day week](https://4dayweek.io/)
As the name implies, they focus on companies that offer four-day work weeks. Sometimes at full salary, other times not.

## Recommended Recruiters
### [Liberty Jobs](https://libertyjobs.com/)
Local to Philadelphia but doing some remote placement since the pandemic. 

### [Dan Christiansen](mailto:Dan.Christiansen@roberthalf.com) at Robert Half
National firm, mostly doing corporate style placement. I've had mixed results with other recruiters at the same firm, but Dan is awesome.

### [Mark Constan](mark@mtcsearchgroup.com)
  Start-up focused, one-man show. He has some amazing contacts. Local to Philadelphia but he's set me up with remote interviews all over.
    
## Etc.
### [How to Prepare Your Resume (Your Resume Stinks!)](https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/10/your-resume-stinks) 
Hall of Fame guidance from the Manager Tools Podcast.

### [Ladders](https://www.theladders.com/) 
This is a paid job board, which is a bummer, but they have a pretty awesome service, Apply4Me, that handles filling out 
those pesky applications that require transcribing your resume into form fields. It definitely saved a lot of time and
headache (and I'm pretty sure I was able to find a coupon code when signing up).
