I've interviewed / hired a lot of engineers and helped plenty of friends land new jobs. These are the resources I always recommend, regardless of which side of the table you're on.

## Smaller Job Boards
There's absolutely nothing wrong with using LinkedIn and Indeed to post and find jobs, but smaller boards often have the gems you won't find elsewhere.

### [Hacker News: Who's Hiring?](https://dheerajck.github.io/hnwhoishiring/)
There's a monthly thread on Hacker News where companies, mostly startups, can post their open roles. These posts often include direct contact info (like emailing the poster) instead of just cold applying through an ATS. The link above is a nice searchable interface for browsing the threads.

### [People-First Jobs](https://peoplefirstjobs.com/)
A hand-curated list of companies and their current job posts. Updates arrive weekly in newsletter format. The curation focuses on companies with strong cultures and good work-life balance, so you're not just scrolling through the same mass postings you'd find elsewhere.

### [4-day week](https://4dayweek.io/)
As the name implies, they focus on companies that offer four-day work weeks. Sometimes at full salary, other times not. Even if you're not specifically hunting for a 4-day role, the companies listed here tend to prioritize employee wellbeing in other ways too.

## Recommended Recruiters
### [Liberty Jobs](https://libertyjobs.com/)
Local to Philadelphia but doing some remote placement since the pandemic. They specialize in tech roles and have solid relationships with companies in the area. I've worked with them as both a candidate and a hiring manager, and they're consistently professional. 

### [Dan Christiansen](mailto:Dan.Christiansen@roberthalf.com) at Robert Half
Robert Half is a national firm that handles both contract and full-time placement, with a strong focus on enterprise and corporate environments. They're a Microsoft Gold Partner, so if you're in the .NET/C# world, they tend to have a lot of relevant roles. I've had mixed results with other recruiters at the firm, but Dan is great because he actually listens and doesn't waste your time with mismatched opportunities.

### [Mark Constan](mailto:mark@mtcsearchgroup.com)
Startup-focused, one-man shop with amazing contacts. Local to Philadelphia but he's set me up with remote interviews all over. Mark takes the time to actually understand what you're looking for instead of just blasting your resume everywhere.
    
## Etc.
### [How to Prepare Your Resume (Your Resume Stinks!)](https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/10/your-resume-stinks)
Hall of Fame guidance from the Manager Tools Podcast. It's from 2005 but the advice is timeless: focus on accomplishments, not responsibilities. I've used this format for years and have recommended it to everyone I've helped with their job search.

### [Ladders](https://www.theladders.com/) 
This is a paid job board, which is a bummer, but they have a pretty awesome service, Apply4Me, that handles filling out 
those pesky applications that require transcribing your resume into form fields. It definitely saved a lot of time and
headache (and I'm pretty sure I was able to find a coupon code when signing up).
