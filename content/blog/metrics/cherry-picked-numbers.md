All too often, companies cherry-pick the numbers they use in their reporting, marketing, and more to deceive without actually lying. 
One technique to see through this is to make sure you're comparing apples to apples e.g. the same periods of time, the same population,
the same volume. Or, as in this example post, the same serving sizes and cost per portion.

Let's start with Kodiak Classic Rolled Oats in a canister. They're using the same form factor as the Quaker Oats in a canister 
we've all known for decades. But blazed across the front of the packaging is "Protein Oats" which implies that Kodiak oats are
doing something special to be higher protein than their competitors. And it's 100% true! Look at the Nutrition Facts.

10g vs. 5g of protein. That's double! But wait... A serving of Kodiak is 50g while a serving of Quaker is 40g. We're not comparing apples
to apples here. If we normalize the two servings to 50 grams, Quaker becomes 187.5 calories and 6.25 grams of protein. Still less than
Kodiak, but not as much as one might think at first glance.

The extra protein comes from adding protein powders to oats (*note that Quaker only contains oats*). This, is of course, buried in the 
nutrition label and not advertised on the front of the tin. But aside from convenience, what's stopping us from adding protein 
powder to quaker? After all, if we added 10 grams of protein powder to the 40 gram serving of Quaker, both portions would be
50 grams, but the Quaker mix would then contain 15 grams of protein. So if you're chasing protein, you're better off adding your
own to Quaker oats.

But would that be more expensive? These are both canisters of oats, so they must cost about the same? Well at my local grocery store, Kodiak costs $5.99 per
canister, while Quaker only costs $4.39 per canister. But that isn't the whole story -- while Kodiak comes in a canister to give the
impression it's the same as Quaker, it actually only contains 9 servings, compared to 13 in the Quaker canister.

If we break the total cost down by serving, Kodiak is 66.5 cents per service while Quaker is only 33.7 cents. So the real question is,
can we add 5 grams of protein powder for about thirty cents? To keep things fair, I found the first unflavored protein at the same
local grocer: $26.99 for 464 grams of protein. 29 cents to add 5 grams to Quaker. 

In conclusion, with the amount of protein and number of servings normalized across both brands, Kodiak costs 66.5 cents compared to 62.7 cents for Quaker.
I'm not recommending you buy one over the other, but now you're armed to decide if you want to spend three extra cents for convenience. 
Keep these ideas in mind when looking at other numbers; make sure you're comparing apples to apples.
