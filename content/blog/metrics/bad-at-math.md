Recently, the [Male/Female Standards Calculator](https://keeper.ai/tools/calculator) has been making the rounds on social
media, ostensibly "to make you think that your standards are too high." {{< rawhtml >}}<span class="sidenote-anchor"></span>{{< /rawhtml >}}
The site tries to legitimize their tool by citing the fact that they use data from the US Census Bureau and the US CDC. But within spending
a minute with the tool, I noticed that the data, as presented, is seriously flawed.

Let's start with the simplest example. If you remove ALL criteria in the calculator -- essentially saying you have no preferences except
for gender -- the calculator already filters out 26% of men and 22% of women. How is that possible?  Well, the calculator only allows you
to select an age from 18 to 70. Only 77.4% of the US population is 18+ and another 6.5% is 75+.

This makes it clear that the calculator is comparing your preferences to the total US population which results in dramatically lower 
percentages. This could be a mistake, or oversight, but my opinion is that it was done in bad faith to further drive the narrative, 
especially considering the FAQ refers to the tool as "the Delusion Calculator".

But more egregious is how the calculator handles data regarding married individuals. Except for the 4-5% of Americans interested in
a polyamorous relationship, most people are looking for a single partner.
