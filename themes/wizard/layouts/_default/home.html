    <p>I'm bad at remembering to finish blog posts. I have a lot of ideas that never get past the first draft stage. I've decided to share drafts here, marked with <strong>[DRAFT]</strong> in the title until they're done.
    This allows me to share things I currently find interesting and update them when I learn something new.</p>
